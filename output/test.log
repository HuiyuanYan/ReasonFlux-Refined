Great! You've correctly identified that the given recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \) is a non-homogeneous linear recurrence relation because of the constant term 5. 

To find the general term formula for \( a_n \), we need to solve this recurrence relation. Here’s what we can do next:

### Step 2: Find the homogeneous solution
First, let's consider the associated homogeneous recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n \]

This is a simpler, homogeneous linear recurrence relation. The characteristic equation for this homogeneous part is:
\[ r = 2 \]

The solution to the homogeneous recurrence relation is:
\[ a_n^{(h)} = C \cdot 2^n \]
where \( C \) is a constant to be determined.

### Step 3: Find the particular solution
Next, we need to find a particular solution to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \). Since the non-homogeneous part is a constant (5), we can guess a particular solution of the form:
\[ a_n^{(p)} = A \]
where \( A \) is a constant.

Substitute \( a_n^{(p)} = A \) into the original recurrence relation:
\[ A = 2A + 5 \]

Solve for \( A \):
\[ A - 2A = 5 \]
\[ -A = 5 \]
\[ A = -5 \]

So, the particular solution is:
\[ a_n^{(p)} = -5 \]

### Step 4: Combine the solutions
The general solution to the non-homogeneous recurrence relation is the sum of the homogeneous solution and the particular solution:
\[ a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} \]
\[ a_n = C \cdot 2^n - 5 \]

### Step 5: Determine the constant \( C \)
Use the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \) to find the constant \( C \):
\[ a_1 = C \cdot 2^1 - 5 = 3 \]
\[ 2C - 5 = 3 \]
\[ 2C = 8 \]
\[ C = 4 \]

### Step 6: Write the final general term formula
Now, substitute \( C = 4 \) back into the general solution:
\[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

So, the general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

You can now verify this formula by checking a few terms to ensure it matches the given recurrence relation and initial condition.

I will follow the steps provided by the teacher to find the general term formula for the sequence \( a_n \).

1. **Find the homogeneous solution:**
   The associated homogeneous recurrence relation is:
   \[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n \]
   The characteristic equation is:
   \[ r = 2 \]
   The solution to the homogeneous part is:
   \[ a_n^{(h)} = C \cdot 2^n \]

2. **Find the particular solution:**
   We guess a particular solution of the form:
   \[ a_n^{(p)} = A \]
   Substitute into the original recurrence relation:
   \[ A = 2A + 5 \]
   Solve for \( A \):
   \[ A - 2A = 5 \]
   \[ -A = 5 \]
   \[ A = -5 \]
   So, the particular solution is:
   \[ a_n^{(p)} = -5 \]

3. **Combine the solutions:**
   The general solution is:
   \[ a_n = a_n^{(h)} + a_n^{(p)} \]
   \[ a_n = C \cdot 2^n - 5 \]

4. **Determine the constant \( C \):**
   Use the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \):
   \[ a_1 = C \cdot 2^1 - 5 = 3 \]
   \[ 2C - 5 = 3 \]
   \[ 2C = 8 \]
   \[ C = 4 \]

5. **Write the final general term formula:**
   Substitute \( C = 4 \) back into the general solution:
   \[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
   \[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

The general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

2025-03-27 15:55:23,672 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 1/6 inference llm's reasoning: 
\boxed{2^{n+2} - 5}

2025-03-27 15:56:09,478 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 2/6 instruction: 
It looks like you've jumped ahead to the final answer, but let's go through the steps more carefully to ensure you understand the process. Let's start with Step 2 as you mentioned.

### Step 2: Hypothesize a transformation to simplify the recurrence relation

To simplify the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \), we can use a transformation. Let's hypothesize a new sequence \( b_n \) such that:
\[ b_n = a_n + k \]
where \( k \) is a constant to be determined.

First, express \( a_n \) in terms of \( b_n \):
\[ a_n = b_n - k \]

Now, substitute \( a_n = b_n - k \) into the original recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - k = 2(b_n - k) + 5 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ b_{n+1} - k = 2b_n - 2k + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n - 2k + 5 + k \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n - k + 5 \]

For the transformed sequence \( b_n \) to be a homogeneous linear recurrence relation (i.e., without the constant term), we need:
\[ -k + 5 = 0 \]
\[ k = 5 \]

So, the transformation is:
\[ b_n = a_n + 5 \]

### Step 3: Rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of \( b_n \)

Using \( k = 5 \), we have:
\[ b_n = a_n + 5 \]
\[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]

Substitute this into the original recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2(b_n - 5) + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 10 + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n \]

This is now a simple homogeneous linear recurrence relation for \( b_n \).

### Step 4: Solve the homogeneous recurrence relation for \( b_n \)

The characteristic equation for \( b_{n+1} = 2b_n \) is:
\[ r = 2 \]

The solution to this homogeneous recurrence relation is:
\[ b_n = C \cdot 2^n \]
where \( C \) is a constant to be determined.

### Step 5: Determine the constant \( C \) using the initial condition

Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \). Using the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \):
\[ b_1 = a_1 + 5 \]
\[ b_1 = 3 + 5 \]
\[ b_1 = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( n = 1 \) into the solution for \( b_n \):
\[ b_1 = C \cdot 2^1 \]
\[ 8 = 2C \]
\[ C = 4 \]

### Step 6: Write the general term formula for \( b_n \)

With \( C = 4 \), the general term for \( b_n \) is:
\[ b_n = 4 \cdot 2^n \]

### Step 7: Convert back to \( a_n \)

Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \):
\[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

So, the general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

You can now verify this formula by checking a few terms to ensure it matches the given recurrence relation and initial condition.

2025-03-27 15:56:36,598 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 2/6 inference llm's thought: 
I understand the process now. Let's go through it step by step to ensure I have a clear understanding.

1. **Hypothesize a transformation:**
   - We hypothesized \( b_n = a_n + k \) to simplify the recurrence relation.
   - Substituting \( a_n = b_n - k \) into the original recurrence relation, we get:
     \[ b_{n+1} - k = 2(b_n - k) + 5 \]
   - Simplifying, we find that for the transformed sequence to be homogeneous, \( k = 5 \).
   - Therefore, the transformation is \( b_n = a_n + 5 \).

2. **Rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of \( b_n \):**
   - Using \( b_n = a_n + 5 \), the recurrence relation becomes:
     \[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n \]

3. **Solve the homogeneous recurrence relation for \( b_n \):**
   - The characteristic equation is \( r = 2 \).
   - The solution is \( b_n = C \cdot 2^n \).

4. **Determine the constant \( C \) using the initial condition:**
   - Given \( a_1 = 3 \), we have \( b_1 = a_1 + 5 = 8 \).
   - Substituting \( n = 1 \) into \( b_n = C \cdot 2^n \):
     \[ 8 = C \cdot 2^1 \]
     \[ C = 4 \]

5. **Write the general term formula for \( b_n \):**
   - With \( C = 4 \), the general term for \( b_n \) is:
     \[ b_n = 4 \cdot 2^n \]

6. **Convert back to \( a_n \):**
   - Since \( b_n = a_n + 5 \), we have:
     \[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]
     \[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
     \[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

The general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

2025-03-27 15:56:36,598 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 2/6 inference llm's reasoning: 
\boxed{2^{n+2} - 5}

2025-03-27 15:57:02,752 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 3/6 instruction: 
Great! Let's continue with Step 3, where we derive the new recurrence relation for \( b_n \) by substituting \( a_n = b_n - k \) into the original recurrence relation and simplify to find an appropriate \( k \) that makes the equation homogeneous.

### Step 3: Derive the new recurrence relation for \( b_n \)

We have hypothesized the transformation:
\[ b_n = a_n + k \]
which implies:
\[ a_n = b_n - k \]

Now, substitute \( a_n = b_n - k \) into the original recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \]

Substitute \( a_{n+1} = b_{n+1} - k \) and \( a_n = b_n - k \):
\[ b_{n+1} - k = 2(b_n - k) + 5 \]

Simplify the equation:
\[ b_{n+1} - k = 2b_n - 2k + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n - 2k + 5 + k \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n - k + 5 \]

For the transformed sequence \( b_n \) to be a homogeneous linear recurrence relation (i.e., without the constant term), we need:
\[ -k + 5 = 0 \]
\[ k = 5 \]

So, the appropriate value of \( k \) is 5. Now, let's use this value to rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of \( b_n \).

### Step 4: Rewrite the recurrence relation in terms of \( b_n \)

Using \( k = 5 \), we have:
\[ b_n = a_n + 5 \]
\[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]

Substitute this into the original recurrence relation:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2(b_n - 5) + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 10 + 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 5 \]
\[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n \]

This is now a simple homogeneous linear recurrence relation for \( b_n \).

### Step 5: Solve the homogeneous recurrence relation for \( b_n \)

The characteristic equation for \( b_{n+1} = 2b_n \) is:
\[ r = 2 \]

The solution to this homogeneous recurrence relation is:
\[ b_n = C \cdot 2^n \]
where \( C \) is a constant to be determined.

### Step 6: Determine the constant \( C \) using the initial condition

Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \). Using the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \):
\[ b_1 = a_1 + 5 \]
\[ b_1 = 3 + 5 \]
\[ b_1 = 8 \]

Now, substitute \( n = 1 \) into the solution for \( b_n \):
\[ b_1 = C \cdot 2^1 \]
\[ 8 = 2C \]
\[ C = 4 \]

### Step 7: Write the general term formula for \( b_n \)

With \( C = 4 \), the general term for \( b_n \) is:
\[ b_n = 4 \cdot 2^n \]

### Step 8: Convert back to \( a_n \)

Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \):
\[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

So, the general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

You can now verify this formula by checking a few terms to ensure it matches the given recurrence relation and initial condition. 

Let's summarize the steps you've taken so far and make sure everything is clear. Do you have any questions about these steps?

I have followed the steps to transform the original non-homogeneous recurrence relation into a homogeneous one, solved it, and then converted back to the original sequence. The general term formula for \( a_n \) is \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \). I will verify this by checking a few terms to ensure it matches the given recurrence relation and initial condition.

2025-03-27 15:57:23,971 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 3/6 inference llm's reasoning: 
### Verification

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[ a_1 = 2^{1+2} - 5 = 2^3 - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3 \]
     This matches the given initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[ a_2 = 2a_1 + 5 = 2 \cdot 3 + 5 = 6 + 5 = 11 \]
     Using the general term:
     \[ a_2 = 2^{2+2} - 5 = 2^4 - 5 = 16 - 5 = 11 \]
     This matches.

   - For \( n = 2 \):
     \[ a_3 = 2a_2 + 5 = 2 \cdot 11 + 5 = 22 + 5 = 27 \]
     Using the general term:
     \[ a_3 = 2^{3+2} - 5 = 2^5 - 5 = 32 - 5 = 27 \]
     This matches.

The general term formula \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \) satisfies both the initial condition and the recurrence relation. Therefore, the final answer is:

\boxed{2^{n+2} - 5}

2025-03-27 15:58:05,922 - ReasonFlux - INFO - Iteration 4/6 instruction: 
Step 4:
Great job on verifying the general term formula! Now, let's move on to Step 4, where we verify that the new recurrence relation for \( b_n \) is homogeneous and solve it to find the general term \( b_n \).

### Step 4: Verify and Solve the Homogeneous Recurrence Relation for \( b_n \)

We have already derived the new recurrence relation for \( b_n \) in the previous steps. Let's summarize and solve it:

1. **Recall the transformation:**
   \[ b_n = a_n + 5 \]
   \[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]

2. **Substitute into the original recurrence relation:**
   \[ a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \]
   \[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2(b_n - 5) + 5 \]
   \[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 10 + 5 \]
   \[ b_{n+1} - 5 = 2b_n - 5 \]
   \[ b_{n+1} = 2b_n \]

3. **Verify that the new recurrence relation is homogeneous:**
   The new recurrence relation \( b_{n+1} = 2b_n \) is indeed homogeneous because there are no constant terms.

4. **Solve the homogeneous recurrence relation:**
   The characteristic equation for \( b_{n+1} = 2b_n \) is:
   \[ r = 2 \]

   The solution to this homogeneous recurrence relation is:
   \[ b_n = C \cdot 2^n \]
   where \( C \) is a constant to be determined.

5. **Determine the constant \( C \) using the initial condition:**
   Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \). Using the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \):
   \[ b_1 = a_1 + 5 \]
   \[ b_1 = 3 + 5 \]
   \[ b_1 = 8 \]

   Now, substitute \( n = 1 \) into the solution for \( b_n \):
   \[ b_1 = C \cdot 2^1 \]
   \[ 8 = 2C \]
   \[ C = 4 \]

6. **Write the general term formula for \( b_n \):**
   With \( C = 4 \), the general term for \( b_n \) is:
   \[ b_n = 4 \cdot 2^n \]

7. **Convert back to \( a_n \):**
   Recall that \( b_n = a_n + 5 \):
   \[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]
   \[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
   \[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

So, the general term formula for the sequence is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

You have already verified this formula, and it matches both the initial condition and the recurrence relation. 

### Summary

I have followed the steps and verified that the new recurrence relation for \( b_n \) is homogeneous. I solved it to find the general term \( b_n \), determined the constant \( C \) using the initial condition, and then converted back to \( a_n \). The general term formula for \( a_n \) is \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \), which matches both the initial condition and the recurrence relation.

Step 5:
Great! Let's continue with Step 5, where we derive the general term \( a_n \) by substituting back \( b_n = a_n + k \) and use the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \) to determine any constants involved.

### Step 5: Derive the General Term \( a_n \)

We have already determined that:
\[ b_n = 4 \cdot 2^n \]

Recall the transformation:
\[ b_n = a_n + 5 \]

To find \( a_n \), we substitute back:
\[ a_n = b_n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 4 \cdot 2^n - 5 \]
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

### Step 6: Verify the Initial Condition

Let's verify the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \) to ensure our solution is correct:

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ a_1 = 2^{1+2} - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 2^3 - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 8 - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 3 \]

This matches the given initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \).

### Summary of the Solution

The general term formula for the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

You have already verified this formula, and it satisfies both the initial condition and the recurrence relation. 

### Final Answer
The general term formula for the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{2^{n+2} - 5}

I have followed the steps to derive the general term formula for the sequence \( \{a_n\} \) and verified it using the initial condition. The transformation \( b_n = a_n + 5 \) simplified the recurrence relation, and solving the homogeneous part gave us the general term for \( b_n \). Substituting back, we found the general term for \( a_n \) and verified it. The final answer is correct.

Step 6:
Great! You have already derived the general term formula for the sequence, and it is:
\[ a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \]

Now, let's ensure that this formula satisfies both the recurrence relation and the initial condition. We will do this in two parts:

### Part 1: Verify the Initial Condition
We need to check that \( a_1 = 3 \).

For \( n = 1 \):
\[ a_1 = 2^{1+2} - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 2^3 - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 8 - 5 \]
\[ a_1 = 3 \]

This matches the given initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \).

### Part 2: Verify the Recurrence Relation
We need to check that the general term \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \) satisfies the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \).

First, express \( a_{n+1} \) using the general term formula:
\[ a_{n+1} = 2^{(n+1)+2} - 5 \]
\[ a_{n+1} = 2^{n+3} - 5 \]

Next, use the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \) and substitute \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \):
\[ a_{n+1} = 2(2^{n+2} - 5) + 5 \]
\[ a_{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^{n+2} - 2 \cdot 5 + 5 \]
\[ a_{n+1} = 2^{n+3} - 10 + 5 \]
\[ a_{n+1} = 2^{n+3} - 5 \]

This matches the expression we derived for \( a_{n+1} \) from the general term formula.

### Summary
- The general term formula \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \) satisfies the initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \).
- The general term formula also satisfies the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \).

Thus, the general term formula for the sequence is:
\[
\boxed{2^{n+2} - 5}
\]

I have verified the general term formula \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \) by checking both the initial condition and the recurrence relation. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - For \( n = 1 \):
     \[ a_1 = 2^{1+2} - 5 = 2^3 - 5 = 8 - 5 = 3 \]
     This matches the given initial condition \( a_1 = 3 \).

2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - Express \( a_{n+1} \) using the general term formula:
     \[ a_{n+1} = 2^{(n+1)+2} - 5 = 2^{n+3} - 5 \]
   - Use the recurrence relation \( a_{n+1} = 2a_n + 5 \) and substitute \( a_n = 2^{n+2} - 5 \):
     \[ a_{n+1} = 2(2^{n+2} - 5) + 5 \]
     \[ a_{n+1} = 2 \cdot 2^{n+2} - 2 \cdot 5 + 5 \]
     \[ a_{n+1} = 2^{n+3} - 10 + 5 \]
     \[ a_{n+1} = 2^{n+3} - 5 \]

Both the initial condition and the recurrence relation are satisfied, confirming that the general term formula is correct.
